.How the app get the data?
The app does get the data from the same endpoint that medium use on their on website, which is:
https://medium.com/_/graphql

And these endpoint requires an authentation to get posts and also there is no limit -as i tested-

Since their on `graphql`, then it is better to use a client like `apollo`, like what i did in this app.

== Notes

.Graphql schema

* Edit schema file:

`/schema.graphql`


* Generate introspection json and put in: (using e.g.: https://transform.tools/graphql-to-introspection-json):

`src/main/graphql/com/medium/schema.json`


* Put all the graphql requests in:

`src/main/graphql/com/medium`
