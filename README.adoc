(and also where i did figure out the logic of the extraction)


== How the app get the data?
The app does get the data from the same endpoint that medium use on their own website, which is:
https://medium.com/_/graphql

And this endpoint doesn't requires an authentation to get posts and also there is no limit -as i tested-

Since they use `graphql`, then it is good to use a client like `apollo` for handling requests.

And you can use link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphql-network-inspector/ndlbedplllcgconngcnfmkadhokfaaln?hl=de[GraphQL Network Inspector] on chrome to understand the medium.com site when developing.

== Notes

.Graphql schema

* Edit schema file:

`/schema.graphql`


* Generate introspection json and put in: (using e.g.: https://transform.tools/graphql-to-introspection-json):

`src/main/graphql/com/medium/schema.json`


* Put all the graphql requests in:

`src/main/graphql/com/medium`
